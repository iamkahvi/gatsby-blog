I have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/techkid105).

It's been fun posting videos. A more involved form of self-expression than instagram.

I have ones about [sailing](https://youtu.be/yli2zN2mV4M), [skiing](https://youtu.be/_Bn3N3SI2-o), [skating](https://youtu.be/4acqZOnjB70), [skating](https://youtu.be/ftmrS3Eg2-I) and [scrambled eggs](https://youtu.be/8iYcGz_nrj8).

I'm only now realizing the alliteration.

One lesson learned: <strong>the edit is all that matters</strong>. For me, 90% of the effort is put in during the edit.
