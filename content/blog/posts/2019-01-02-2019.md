Iâ€™m going into this year feeling good. Mostly because it started exactly on the beat switch in Nights.

Few points:
- Write down thoughts and experiences so that I will remember them
- Need to start looking at my haircut from a side-on view (tell barber)
- Stop blow-drying hair
- Do more sober things with friends (cards, movies, day-trips, etc)
- Prioritize health
- Wake-up early
- Set specific goals to get things done
- Try not to slouch
- Take more chances 
- Always be willing to learn
- Go skydiving
- Enjoy silence
- At least 7.5 hours sleep
- Cook with rice more
- Wear a turtleneck with a blazer to an event
- Drink more water
- Knit
- Stop watching corny movies instead of good ones
- Be grateful

**Happy New Year!**
