Current State: Long hair
- Pros:
    - Looks better than short hair IMO
    - Takes less time to prepare (Effort to Look ratio is great)
    - Less money spent on haircuts (more efficient for financials)
    - Looks slightly better with hats
    - Compliments facial hair
- Cons:
    - When let down, it is impossible to manage
    - Gets greasy quite quickly (Discourages working out)
    - Is sometimes uncomfortable when in bad bun
    - Takes a long time to dry (Discourages working out)
    - Extra weight?
    - Cumbersome with hoods
    - Discourages lying down
    - Looks less professional/trustworthy

Alternative: Short hair
- Pros:
    - Easier to manage
    - Would be more comfortable and usable
    - Less weight?
    - Less time to dry (encourages working out)
    - Looks more professional/trustworthy
    - Could add height
- Cons:
    - Doesn’t look as good IMO
    - Requires more haircuts
    - More time to prepare in the morning
    - Doesn’t really compliment the facial hair
