Hi, I'm Kahvi. It's pronounced like [this](/assets/pronounce4.m4a). I currently work as a developer at Shopify. I used to study computer science at the University of Victoria. Before that, I studied philosophy at the University of King's College in Halifax.
This is my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf) and [GitHub](https://github.com/iamkahvi).
I used to do art. This is my <a href="http://archive.kahvipatel.com/portfolio.html" target="_blank">portfolio</a>. My old blog lives <a href="http://archive.kahvipatel.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
