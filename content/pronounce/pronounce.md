## Congratulations! You have mispronounced my name.

Don't worry, this is a *common mistake* and one I don't take any offense to.

For future reference, my name is pronounced **KUH-vee** (*contrary to it's spelling* ðŸ« ). Like

Here are some phonetic references:
- Kahvi as in **KUH-vee**-lovey-dovey
- Kahvi as in a [covey of quails](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+covey):

- Kahvi as in sh**ovey**
- Kahvi as in **cov**enant
- Kahvi as in **cu**bby (except instead of **b** it's a **v**)
