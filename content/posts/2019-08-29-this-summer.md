## working
Having a full-time job changed patterns in my lifestyle. Waking up at 7am everyday isn't a big deal anymore. It just happens. Even on weekends.  
I have a nice seperation between work and my life. My work laptop stays at the office, which makes it easier to enjoy the summer on the weekends.  
That said, I think about my job alot. I think about what I'm working on, if this is what I want my career to look like, how I should work on myself to become a better employee. Big questions.  
I've been fortunate to land a job in a workplace that supports my learning. Talking about concepts and technologies I'm interested in with someone smart makes so much more sense to me than lecturers. I'm learning  more efficiently than I ever did in University.  
Obviously though, it's not my supervisor's job to teach me. That's why I pay tuition and my work pays me a salary.  
I've discovered that working in an office, especially a small one, makes you develop real friendship with co-workers. And I've been lucky enough to work with people that I hope to keep in touch with.

Summer ending is always sad. But I'm grateful this job worked out. It's scary stepping into a workplace you don't know alot about. Just gotta trust your instincts I guess.  

## hobbies
I've probably raved about this somewhere on the blog. But I value consistency over intensity. Aristotle [said](https://medium.com/the-mission/my-favourite-quote-of-all-time-is-a-misattribution-66356f22843d)
> “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.”

That said, this has *not* been a summer of hobbies. I played basketball regularly for about three weeks. I ran a 10k on Sundays about five times. I definitely haven't been writing blog posts. I have been reading. I've been smoking weed about weekly. 

## relationships
I was in a relationship for a while this summer. I won't talk much about it here. But I did learn that if you are going to take a relationship seriously, it takes a bunch of time and *work*. And I realized how little experience I have with that.
