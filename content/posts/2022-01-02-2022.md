I've missed my yearly resolution deadline of January 2nd. I'm actually typing this on January 3rd and you're seeing it sometime after that. Regardless, the published date of this post is January 2nd because I have absolute journalistic freedom on this blog. Beware.

Reading last years resolutions has been a mixed bag.

I started a new job in 2021. 

I've been feeling challenged by the work I do. And the people around me are smart and kind and supportive. The remote part is tough, but I'm getting better at taking advantage of it.

My resolution to *create more* and *consume less* has been coming true towards the end of 2021. I’m playing more piano and posting more jams on TikTok. I'm taking more pictures and videos of things.

I’ve failed miserably on my resolution to spend 5 minutes a day in self-reflection. The reminder on my phone gets ignored 99% of the time. Ironically, the 1% of the time I do reflect, that time ends up being immensly valuable.

It lets me consider parts of my day, how my body is feeling, any subtle stressors. It lets me set intent for what I want to do next instead of drifting from activity to activity.

It's weird how that works. 

When I take the time to sit down, with nothing in my face, just staring distantly and *thinking*, it's ***always*** a good use of my time.

But I can't force myself to do it. The transition from phone --> reflecting is so hard. Pulling myself away from that thing is horribly difficult. Playing piano --> reflecting is a bit easier. After workout --> reflecting is easier still.

I think I just need to read this and follow along with it: https://www.chrisbehan.ca/posts/atomic-habits.

Maybe that'll be one of this year's resolutions. Implementing the recomendations from Atomic Habits. Does that make sense? Sort of an underwhelming resolution.

I want to move to Montreal. That one is more exciting.

I'd like to start posting more on my Instagram Story. In part to keep people up to date with what I'm up to/where I am and also to have virtual memories to look back on. 

I want to get a fun phone case. And tattoos, more jewelry, etc.

I want to get a promotion at work. Boring.

I want to run a marathon. Ambitious.

I want to get LASIK. Exciting.

I read 22 books in 2021 and I want to read 23 in 2022. Brag.

And, as always, I would like to be able to do a standing front flip.

See you next year.
