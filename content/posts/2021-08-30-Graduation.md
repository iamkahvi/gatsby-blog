I’ve recently graduated. And just turned 23. And I’m about to start a serious job and move into my own apartment.

I don’t know if I should reflect on my university career, my 22nd year, or just this moment in my life. 

A big step, end of a chapter, start of the rest of my life kinda thing.

What happened in university? 
- I moved across the country
- I made good friends
- I discovered computer science
- I became more independent
- I lived with roommates
- I learned how to cook
- I lived in Victoria and explored the island
- I took many cross-Canada flights
- I kept in touch with people
- I read a lot of books
- I watched a lot of TV
- I played a lot of ultimate
- I ran
- I sometimes got intoxicated 

Why is it such a big deal?
I’ll still keep doing most of those things, right?

This degree is part of my identity, to an extent. The university, the city, the island are now things that I recognize, that I’m used to.

I feel like I’ve built up momentum in university. My discovering computer science has propelled me to where I am now. I feel like going faster, an acceleration. I think my job will be the right place to focus that energy.

For me, this next phase of my life contains nothing especially new. I’ve already worked the same job for 4 months during my internship. Obviously, I’ll be able to dive deeper into every aspect of the job. But in general, I have a pretty good idea of what to expect.

I never thought I'd continue doing school immediately after my undergrad. I have always been anxious to start living outside the educational setting.

I would like to go to law school. But later on. Once I’ve learned how to work hard like Obama did.

I’m moving into my own apartment in September and I want to play music all the time in it. I must purchase a good speaker system.

There’s an overwhelming sense of gratefulness. I’ve been so lucky in my life with the people I’ve met, the family I have, the places I’ve been. It is truly terrifying to consider what my life would’ve been like had I not been so fortunate.

What has been true for most of my life will continue being true: It’s less the big decisions that define me than the small, consistent habits.
