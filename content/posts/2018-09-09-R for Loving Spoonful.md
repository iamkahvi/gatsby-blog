I made some apps with Shiny and R to visualize the data gathered with several programs that were implemented last year.

The [first app](https://lovingspoonful.shinyapps.io/app1/) I created to give an easy overview of the food reclamation growth over the course of 12 months. This would help anticipate trends to prepare more effectively for the next year.

After that, I used data from a collection program I help implement in the summer of 2017 to give a helpful visualization of what kinds of food were donated most often and at what frequency. This [app ](https://lovingspoonful.shinyapps.io/app2/) is here.
