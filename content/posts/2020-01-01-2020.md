I'm going into this new year feeling hungover. But optimistic.

Few points:
- I want to become more confident in my dev knowledge
- Take advantage of sunny days
- Read in the hammock more
- Try for better posture
- Make taco tuesdays a thing
- Go to more formal events because I like wearing a suit
- Stretch more often
- Don't speak on things you haven't read enough about
- Have a consistent sleep schedule
- Get off tik tok
- Volunteer (big-brother, tutor)
- TA a lab at UVic
- Set specific goals to get things done (repeat from last year)
- Use the food processor to cook
- Do more passive activities without a screen (yo-yoing, juggling, ball in cup thing, kodama)
- Wear more interesting clothes
- Start drinking coffee??
- Go skiing at mount washington
- Make more vlogs for myself to enjoy
- Do more trips in the civic
- Find a good therapist
