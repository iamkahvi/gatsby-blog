    "quote": "Lindemann’s discovery was a milestone for number theory. It also settled, once and for all, what was probably the most celebrated unsolved problem in mathematics: whether or not it was ple to square the circle. In order to explain how it did this, however, I need to introduce the formula that says that the area of a circle is r2, where r is the radius. (The radius is the distance from the centre to the side, or half the diameter.) A visual proof of why this is true is an instance where a pie is the best metaphor for pi. Imagine you have two same-sized circular pies, a white one and a grey one, as below in A. The circumference of each pie is pi times the diameter, or pi times twice the radius, or 2pr. When sliced into equal segments the pieces can be rearranged, as in B with quarter segments, or as in C with ten segments. In both cases the length of the side remains 2pr. If we keep on slicing smaller and smaller segments, then the shape would eventually become a rectangle, as in D, with sides r and 2r. The area of the rectangle – which is the area of the two pies – is therefore 2r2, so the area of one pie is r2.",

For example, 221 is 13×17. The next number, 222, is 2×3×37. The one after that, 223, is prime, so produced only by 223×1, and 224 is 2×2×2×2 × 2 × 7. We could carry on for ever and each number could be winnowed down to a product of primes in only one possible way.

    "quote": "Some numbers are squares, such as 1, 4, 9 and 16, and some are not squares, such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc. 2. The totality of all numbers must be greater than the total of squares, since the totality of all numbers includes squares and non-squares. 3. Yet for every number, we can draw a one-to-one correspondence between numbers and their squares, for example: 4. So, there are, in fact, as many squares as there are numbers. Which is a contradiction, since we have said, in point 2, that there are more numbers than squares. Galileo’s",

    "quote": "Mathematics, as I wrote in the opening chapters of this book, emerged as part of man’s desire to make sense of his own environment. By making notches on wood, or counting with fingers, our ancestors invented numbers. This was helpful for farming and trade, and ushered us into ‘civilization’. Then, as mathematics developed, the subject became less about real things and more about abstract ones. The Greeks introduced concepts such as a point and a line, and the Indians invented zero, which opened the door to even more radical abstractions like negative numbers. While these concepts were at first counter-intuitive, they were assimilated quickly and we now use them on a daily basis. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the umbilical cord linking mathematics to our own experience snapped once and for all. After Riemann and Cantor, maths lost its connection to any intuitive appreciation of the world.",
