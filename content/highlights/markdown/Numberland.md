> When numbers are spread out evenly on a ruler, the scale is called linear. When numbers get closer as they get larger, the scale is called logarithmic.* It turns out that the logarithmic approach is not exclusive to Amazonian Indians. We are all born conceiving numbers this way.

> The most common bases throughout history have been five, ten and twenty, and there is an obvious reason why. These numbers are derived from the human body. We have five fingers on one hand, so five is the first obvious place to take a breath when counting upwards from one. The next natural pause comes at two hands, or ten fingers, and after that at hands and feet, or twenty fingers and toes.

> an ingenious – if rather overly intricate – technique allows you to count up to one less than ten billion – 9,999,999,999. Each finger has nine imaginary points – three on each crease line, as marked on the diagram opposite. These points on the right little finger represent the digits 1 to 9. The points on the right fourth finger take us from 10 to 90. The right middle finger goes from 100 to 900, and so on, with each new finger representing the next power of ten. It is therefore possible to count every single person on Earth with only your fingers, which is one way to have the whole world in your hands.

> In this Chinese system, each finger has nine points, representing the digits 1 to 9 for each order of magnitude, so the right hand can express any number up to 105– 1 when the other hand touches the relevant points. Swapping hands, the numbers continue to 1010– 1. A ‘zero’ point is not needed on any finger, since when there are no values relating to that finger it is simply left alone by the other hand.

English number words, by contrast, take just under a third of a second to say (thanks to the frankly cumbersome ‘seven’, with two syllables, and the extended syllable ‘three’), so our limit in two seconds is seven.

> Lindemann’s discovery was a milestone for number theory. It also settled, once and for all, what was probably the most celebrated unsolved problem in mathematics: whether or not it was ple to square the circle. In order to explain how it did this, however, I need to introduce the formula that says that the area of a circle is r2, where r is the radius. (The radius is the distance from the centre to the side, or half the diameter.) A visual proof of why this is true is an instance where a pie is the best metaphor for pi. Imagine you have two same-sized circular pies, a white one and a grey one, as below in A. The circumference of each pie is pi times the diameter, or pi times twice the radius, or 2pr. When sliced into equal segments the pieces can be rearranged, as in B with quarter segments, or as in C with ten segments. In both cases the length of the side remains 2pr. If we keep on slicing smaller and smaller segments, then the shape would eventually become a rectangle, as in D, with sides r and 2r. The area of the rectangle – which is the area of the two pies – is therefore 2r2, so the area of one pie is r2.

> Hobbes replied to Wallis’s comments with an addendum to his book entitled Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics. Wallis countered with Due Correction for Mr Hobbes in School Discipline for not saying his Lessons right. Hobbes followed this with Marks of the Absurd Geometry, Rural Language, Scottish Church Politics and Barbarisms of John Wallis. This led to Wallis’s Hobbiani Puncti Dispunctio! or the Undoing of Mr Hobbes’s Points. The quarrelling lasted almost a quarter of a century, until Hobbes’s death in 1679.

> algebra. Start by choosing any three-digit number in which the first and last digits differ by at least two – for example, 753. Now, reverse this number to get 357. Subtract the smaller from the larger: 753 – 357 = 396. Finally, add this number to its reverse: 396 + 693. The sum you get is 1089. Try it again, with a different number, say 421. 421 – 124 = 297 297 + 792 = 1089

> Consider the number 614. This is equal to 600 + 10 + 4. In fact, any three-digit number written abc can be written 100a + 10b + c (note: abc in this case is not a×b×c). So, let’s call our initial number abc, where a, b and c are single digits. For the sake of convenience, make a bigger than c. The reverse of abc is cba which can be expanded as 100c + 10b + a. We are required to subtract cba from abc to give an intermediary result. So abc – cba is: (100a + 10b + c) – (100c + 10b + a) The two b terms cancel each other out, leaving an intermediary result of: 99ac, or 99(a – c) At a basic level algebra doesn’t involve any special insight, but rather the application of certain rules. The aim is to apply these rules until the expression is as simple as possible. The term 99(a – c) is as neatly arranged as it can be. Since the first and last digits in abc differ by at least 2, then a – c is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8. So, 99(a – c) is one of the following: 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693 or 792. Whatever three-figure number we started with, once we have subtracted it from its reverse, we have an intermediary result that is one of the above eight numbers. The final stage is to add this intermediary number to its reverse. Let’s repeat what we did before and apply it to the intermediary number. We’ll call our intermediary number def, which is 100d + 10e + f. We want to add def to fed, its reverse. Looking closely at the list of possible intermediary numbers above, we see that the middle number, e, is always 9. And also that the first and third numbers always add up to 9, in other words d + f = 9. So, def + fed is: 100d + 10e + f + 100f + 10e + d Or: 100(d + f ) + 20e + d + f Which is: (100 × 9) + (20 × 9) + 9 Or: 900 + 180 + 9 Hey presto! The total is 1089, and the riddle is laid bare.

> Second, every natural number above 1 can be written as a unique product of imes. In other words, every number is equal to a unique set of prime numbers multiplied by each other. For example, 221 is 13×17. The next number, 222, is 2×3×37. The one after that, 223, is prime, so produced only by 223×1, and 224 is 2×2×2×2 × 2 × 7. We could carry on for ever and each number could be winnowed down to a product of primes in only one possible way. For example, a billion is 2×2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5. This characteristic of numbers is known as the fundamental theorem of arithmetic,

The answer is only 0.34, or about a third.

The value of every other position is the sum of the two numbers above it.

> There is only one combination of three items: mango, lychee, banana. If we want to select only two fruits, we can do this in three different ways: mango and lychee, mango and banana, lychee and banana. There are also only three ways of taking the fruit individually, which is each fruit on its own. The final option is to select zero fruit, and this can happen in only one way. In other words, the number of combinations of three different fruits produces the string 1, 3, 3, 1 – the third line of Pascal’s triangle.

> We saw from the quincunx that random errors are distributed normally. So, the more random errors we can introduce into measurement, the more likely it is that we will get a bell curve from the data – even if the phenomenon being measured is not normally distributed. When the normal distribution is found in a set of data, this could simply be because the measurements have been gathered too shambolically.

> Regression to the mean is not a complicated idea. All it says is that if the outcome of an event is determined at least in part by random factors, then an extreme event will probably be followed by one that is less extreme.

> Yet despite its simplicity, regression is not appreciated by most people. I would say, in fact, that regression is one of the least grasped but most useful mathematical concepts you need for a rational understanding of the world. A surprisingly large number of simple misconceptions about science and statistics boil down to a failure to take regression to the mean into account.

> Euclid proved all 465 theorems of The Elements with only five axioms, which are more commonly known as his five postulates: 1. There is a straight line from any point to any point. 2. A finite straight line can be produced in any straight line. 3. There is a circle with any centre and any radius. 4. All right angles are equal to one another. 5. If a straight line falling on two given straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two given straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.

> Some numbers are squares, such as 1, 4, 9 and 16, and some are not squares, such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, etc. 2. The totality of all numbers must be greater than the total of squares, since the totality of all numbers includes squares and non-squares. 3. Yet for every number, we can draw a one-to-one correspondence between numbers and their squares, for example: 4. So, there are, in fact, as many squares as there are numbers. Which is a contradiction, since we have said, in point 2, that there are more numbers than squares. Galileo’s

> Mathematics, as I wrote in the opening chapters of this book, emerged as part of man’s desire to make sense of his own environment. By making notches on wood, or counting with fingers, our ancestors invented numbers. This was helpful for farming and trade, and ushered us into ‘civilization’. Then, as mathematics developed, the subject became less about real things and more about abstract ones. The Greeks introduced concepts such as a point and a line, and the Indians invented zero, which opened the door to even more radical abstractions like negative numbers. While these concepts were at first counter-intuitive, they were assimilated quickly and we now use them on a daily basis. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, the umbilical cord linking mathematics to our own experience snapped once and for all. After Riemann and Cantor, maths lost its connection to any intuitive appreciation of the world.
